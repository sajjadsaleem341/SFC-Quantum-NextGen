# Climate Change Earth Surface Temperature Data

Global surface temperature data sets are an essential resource for monitoring and understanding climate variability and climate change.Scientists have been making projections of future global warming using climate models of increasing complexity for the past four decades

 Given the size and tremendous heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The 2-degree increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat. That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals—expanding some and shrinking others.
